# Specification Mining for Smart Contracts with Trace Slicing and Predicate Abstraction
---

### Contents
This repository contains the artifact for ASE submission ``Specification Mining for Smart Contracts with Trace Slicing and Predicate Abstraction``.

We briefly introduce its repostory structure as follows.
- [Smcon](#), The source code developed and used by the paper.
- [Experiment-data](#), The generated automata for each smart contracts as well as its ground truth.
- [Dicether.sh](#), The script to run the experiment for Dicether-gamechannel example.
- [result](#) and [tmp](#) host the slice configurations of smart contracts used to slice transaction hisotry and we also cache the transaction data of Dicether-gamechannel (0x7e..) to allow user to reproduce the result.
